# Machine_Learning-All-Model-In-One

This Repository Contain All Machine Learning Models With Examples and Projects

## Getting Started
In this section you should provide instructions on how to use this repository to recreate your project locally.

### Dependencies
Here, list all libraries, packages and other dependencies that need to be installed to run your project. Include library versions and how they should be installed if a special requirement is needed. 


This git page provides a simple readme with some documentation and tips regarding machine learning in Python. The intended use of this page was to serve as a personal reference sheet when developing machine learning models using Python, but I have decided to share with whoever else might find these resources useful. Contained within the repository :

Algorithm List :

- Linear Regression
- Logistics Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Boosting
- PCA
- SVM
- Naive Bayes

## Unsuperviesed Algorithms
### Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- K-means

# Dependencies
## 1.Numpy
Allows you to work with arrays and do mathametical operations
```import numpy as np```

## 2.Pandas
Allows you to import a dataset and easily create vectors and matrices
```import pandas as pd```

Importing a Dataset: 
Allows you to get dataset into your model 
```dataset = pd.read_csv('Data.csv')```
(Just change the name of csv file according to the name of dataset)
